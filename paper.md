# Summary
**SDSCMT (Secure Data SSL Certificate Management Tool)** is a Python-based command-line tool designed to simplify the generation, validation, conversion, and monitoring of self-signed SSL certificates and private keys. It supports seamless conversion between PEM, DER, and PKCS#12 formats and provides a user-friendly interface for securely managing certificates in development and testing environments. SDSCMT is intended for developers, DevOps engineers, and security practitioners who need a reliable and automated solution for certificate management.

# Statement of need
Managing SSL/TLS certificates is a critical task for ensuring secure communications, even in internal or test environments. While commercial certificate management solutions exist, they are often expensive, complex, or not tailored for local development workflows. Self-signed certificates are widely used in development, testing, and internal networks, but managing them manually is error-prone and tedious.  

Existing Python libraries provide APIs for cryptography and certificate handling (`cryptography`, `pyOpenSSL`), but they lack a unified CLI tool for generating, validating, converting, and monitoring certificates. SDSCMT addresses this gap by offering a **single, comprehensive tool** with a simple interface that automates common certificate management tasks.

# Features
SDSCMT provides the following capabilities:

- **Generate self-signed certificates** with customizable validity period, hostname, and organization details.
- **Validate existing private keys** and certificates to ensure correctness and consistency.
- **Convert certificates** between PEM, DER, and PKCS#12 formats.
- **Encrypt private keys** optionally for added security.
- **Command-line interface** for ease of use, supporting both interactive and script-based workflows.
- **Cross-platform support** (Windows, Linux, macOS) via Python 3.

# Software description

## Installation
Install SDSCMT from PyPI:

```bash
pip install sdscmt
```

# Example Usage

After installing SDSCMT, you can use the tool via the command line or Python module.

## Command Line Interface

```sh
$ sdscmt

1. Generate self-signed certificate
2. Validate and display existing private key
3. Validate and display existing certificate (crt) file
4. Encrypt private key (recommended)
5. Cert Conversion Tool to convert cert from one type (DER, PKCS12, PEM) to another (DER, PKCS12, PEM)

# Implementation

SDSCMT is implemented in **Python 3** and leverages `cryptography` and `pyOpenSSL` for cryptographic operations. The CLI is built using standard Python `argparse` for cross-platform compatibility. The tool handles certificate creation, validation, conversion, and encryption securely and efficiently.

# Impact

SDSCMT simplifies certificate management in development, testing, and internal networks. By automating repetitive tasks, it reduces human error, enforces best practices for self-signed certificates, and makes SSL/TLS management accessible to non-experts. Its open-source nature encourages adoption, extension, and integration into DevOps workflows.

# Quality control

- **Unit tests** cover generation, conversion, and validation functions.  
- **Cross-platform testing** ensures correct behavior on Linux, macOS, and Windows.  
- **Input validation** prevents invalid certificate parameters.  
- **Documentation and usage examples** guide users through all functionalities.

# Acknowledgements

Thanks to the **Python Software Foundation** and the open-source community for providing foundational cryptography libraries.
